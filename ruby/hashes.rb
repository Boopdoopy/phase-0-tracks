# Initialize a hash
# Prompt the designer/user for all of this information.
# Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.
# Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.
# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine).
# If the designer says "none", skip it. 
#the designer enters "decor_theme" (ex) ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. 
#(Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) 
#You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.
# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.



#iterate through hash prompting with key and getsing that value
  #pref and ombre need seperate cases
#convert user input to appropriate data type
#fill in that value
#print the hash
#ask user if they want to add a key (y/n)
#if y create new key (turn into symbol) and prompt for value
#print the hash

#|key,value| puts "What is your #{key}?"
