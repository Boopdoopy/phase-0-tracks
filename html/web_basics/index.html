<h1>Day 0</h1>
<p>The <i>S.S. Queen Disney</i> sank today. 
There were 8 others who joined my fiance and I on this little life raft. 
6 other passengers and the ship's greeter.

<p>We turned to cannibalism within the first hour.
Neither of us had eaten since breakfast and my fairer half is an excellent 
leader in a crisis.</p>

<p>Not that we were hungry, mind you. 
But curing meat properly takes days and as <i>Tony Robbins</i> always says:
<strong>The path to success is to take massive, determined action.</strong></p>

<p>I've included a link to the rough draft of the <em>the recipe</em> below</p>
